a) Create two fractions (Fraction class objects). Let these fractions be equal to 2/3 and 3/4.

b) Create a global split() function that divides two fractions by itself and returns the result (returned
type is Fraction). The function, as arguments, has to take two objects of type Fraction.
Use the function to divide the previously created 2/3 fraction by a fraction of 3/4.

c) Use the split() function to divide a previously created fraction of 2/3 by the number of
integer of type 4 int (number 4 is to be the second argument passed to the function).

d) Create a global element() function that returns the square root of the number passed
as an argument. The type of argument that the function takes is to be double. You want the function to return
double type. Use a function to calculate a square root from a previously created
a fraction of 2/3. View the result. Use a converting operator to complete this task.
